# data-structures
Basic Algorithms and Data Structures implemented in C++ and Python

A set of basic algorithms and data structures, done as practice for coding interviews. They're essentially implementations of the pseudocode in Cormen et al. "Introduction to Algorithms" MIT Press. They might be helpful if you're a beginner trying to implement these algorithms from scratch for the first time.
